MyWorks - Python - VirtualEnv

Install python libraries on a virtual environment. It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn’t share libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally doesn’t access the globally installed libraries either).

to Install:

$ [sudo] pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment for a project:

$ cd my_project_folder $ virtualenv venv

virtualenv venv will create a folder in the current directory which will contain the Python executable files, and a copy of the pip library which you can use to install other packages. The name of the virtual environment (in this case, it was venv) can be anything; omitting the name will place the files in the current directory instead.This creates a copy of Python in whichever directory you ran the command in, placing it in a folder named venv.

You can also use a Python interpreter of your choice.

$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv This will use the Python interpreter in /usr/bin/python2.7

To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated: $ source venv/bin/activate
